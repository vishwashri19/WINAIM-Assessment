-- SQL Queries

-- Query 1: Find all employees who have been hired in the last year.
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE());

-- Query 2: Calculate the total salary expenditure for each department.
SELECT d.department_name, SUM(s.salary) AS total_salary_expenditure
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;

-- Query 3: Find the top 5 highest-paid employees along with their department names.
SELECT TOP 5 e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name, s.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY s.salary DESC;
